# Basic/Starter VS Code Settings

The enclosed `settings.json` file contains a list of basic — or starter —
entries for your VS Code’s environment. Depending on your platform, the user
settings file is located here:

Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json`
macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json`
Linux: `$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json`

If your `settings.json` file is empty, then replace the file with the enclosed
`settings.json` file.

If you already have name/value pairs in `settings.json`, then *copy* the
name/value pairs from the enclosed `settings.json` file into your VS Code’s
`settings.json` file.
